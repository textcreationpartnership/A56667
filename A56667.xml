            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE to the READER.</head>
            <p>THAT which is here offered to thy Peruſal, was occaſioned by ſome late Pamphlets
<note n="*" place="margin">Succeſſion of Church and Sacraments. Conſenſus Veterum. Nubes Teſtium.</note>, that appeared, much about the ſame time, in Print, pretending by a Heap of Teſtimonies from the <hi>Fathers</hi> to prove, as in ſome other Doctrines, ſo particularly in that of the <hi>Corporal Preſence</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> That the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> and the <hi>preſent Roman,</hi> are at a good Agreement.</p>
            <p>It is very hard for <hi>Us</hi> to believe this, and ſcarce credible that <hi>they themſelves</hi> did ſo, when we ſee ſo much Unſincerity in their Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſuch Deceit and contrived diſguiſing the Senſe of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in their Tranſlations; ſuch late, uncertain, and ſuppoſititious Writings ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, under the Venerable Names of <hi>Ancient Authors:</hi> When the way that <hi>Procruſtes</hi> took, of ſtretching Limbs, or chopping them off, to make all agree to his Bed who were to be laid in it, is uſed to make the <hi>Ancient</hi> and the <hi>Preſent Church</hi> to agree, a <hi>Conſent</hi> thus procured can occaſion but a ſhort and a ſorry Triumph.
<pb facs="tcp:64618:3"/>Yet thoſe Performances have been cry'd up, and they are look'd upon as <hi>Storehouſes</hi> and <hi>Repoſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> whence any Champion of theirs who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Liſts, may be furniſh'd from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> either with what is neceſſary for his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or the aſſailing of an Adverſary. The <hi>Repreſenter,</hi> ſince that, made great uſe of them, in a brisk Attaque he made upon the <hi>Dublin Letter,</hi> tho' the Succeſs, I believe, did not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his Expectation. The <hi>Convert of Putney</hi>'s Performance (who in his <hi>Conſenſus Veterum</hi> made the largeſt Shew of Fathers on behalf of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation) has had a particular Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given it, by his worthy Anſwerer
<note n="*" place="margin">Veteres Vindicati.</note>: And ſo all the other Teſtimonies in the reſt of them, that are of any ſeeming ſtrength and moment, have received Anſwers to them from other Hands; particularly from the Learned Author of <hi>The Doctrine of the Trinity and Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion compared, Part</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>If any thing, after all, ſeems to be wanting on our Part, it is this; That as our Adverſaries have made a <hi>Shew of Fathers</hi> (for I can give it no better name) pretended to countenance their Doctrines of the <hi>Corporal Preſence</hi> and <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation;</hi> ſo we alſo ought to have <hi>our Collection of Teſtimonies</hi> from the <hi>Ancients,</hi> made faithfully and impartially, wherein their true Senſe in
<pb facs="tcp:64618:3"/>theſe Matters may be clearly ſeen and viewed, and thereby their Diſſent from this Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear plainly, in thoſe things that either <hi>conſtitute</hi> this Doctrine, or are neceſſary <hi>Conſequents</hi> of it. And this is that which I have undertaken in the following Papers; wherein as the Uſefulneſs of the Deſign has encourag'd me to take ſome Pains, ſo I ſhall think them well beſtowed, if the Reader will bring an honeſt and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd Mind to the Peruſal of them, and ſuffer himſelf to be determin'd in his Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Controverſie, according to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Truth here offered for his Conviction. If the Differences (which the annexed Contents of the Chapters give an Account of) are of ſuch a Nature, and ſtand at ſuch a wide Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that it's impoſſible ever to bring Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation to ſhake Hands with them as Friends; and if the two Churches, the <hi>Ancient</hi> and the <hi>Preſent Roman,</hi> are really divided and diſagreeing, as I pretend to have demonſtrated, in thoſe Points, it will then I hope hereafter be ridiculous, to talk confidently of a <hi>Conſent of Fathers,</hi> and of a <hi>Cloud of Witneſſes</hi> on their Side.</p>
            <p>But if I am herein miſtaken, I am ſo little tender of my Reputation, compared with Truth, that I heartily deſire to be confuted and made a Convert; for I am conſcious to my
<pb facs="tcp:64618:4"/>ſelf of no falſe Fathers I have cited for true ones; of no diſguiſing or perverting their Senſe, by an Ill Tranſlation of their Words; (which I have therefore ſet down in their own Language) of no impoſing upon the Reader a Senſe of my own making, contrary to what I believe that they intended.</p>
            <p>I have but one Requeſt more to make to the unknown Author of a Book intituled, <hi>Reaſon and Authority, &amp;c.</hi> who mentioning the <hi>Defence of the Dublin Letter</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 119.</note> (for which I have ſome reaſon to be concern'd) ſays, That <hi>the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Fathers there urged are, as he conceives, in the Senſe of them, either miſtaken or miſapplied, and that he ſhall endeavour to reconcile them to other Expreſſions of the Fathers, and to</hi> (that which he calls) <hi>the Catholick Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> I humbly deſire, when he is about this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling Work,</hi> and his Hand is in, that he would go on to reconcile alſo the <hi>Differences</hi> urged in the following Papers. Which if he ſhall do to any purpoſe, I promiſe to return the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements he has paſs'd upon <hi>that Defender</hi> with Intereſt, and to alter my preſent Opinion of him, upon his Performances in that Book.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. The Firſt Difference. <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is forced to aſſert a continued Series of Miracles to juſtifie her Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation. But the Fathers never mention any Miracles in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, ſave only the Effects of God's powerful Grace, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Changes in us, and advancing the Elements in the uſe of them thereunto, without changing their Nature and Subſtance.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TO give the Reader a View of what Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are to be believed, according to what the <hi>Trent Council</hi> has decreed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> we need go no further than to the <hi>Trent Catechiſm</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ad Parccho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, part. 2. num. 25.</note>, which tells us, there are <hi>three moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things, which the Catholick Faith without any doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, believes and confeſſes are effected in this Sacrament, by the Words of Conſecration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the true Body of Christ, that ſame Body which was born of the Virgin, and ſits at the Right-hand of the Father, is conteined in this Sacrament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That no Subſtance of the Elements remains in it, tho' nothing may ſeem more ſtrange and remote from our Senſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>What is eaſily collected from both, That the Accidents, which are ſeen with our Eyes, or are perceived by our other Senſes, are without any Subject</hi> (in which they ſubſiſt) <hi>in a ſtrange manner, not to be explained. So that all the Accidents of Bread and Wine may be ſeen, which yet inhere in no Subſtance, but ſubſist by themſelves, ſince the Subſtance of the Bread and Wine are ſo changed into the very Body and Blood of our Lord, that the Subſtance of Bread and Wine ceaſe wholly to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64618:9"/>But others of the Romiſh Writers have made a larger and more particular Enumeration of the Miracles wrought in the Euchariſt, which no Created Power can effect, but God's Omnipotency alone. I'le give them in the Words of the Jeſuite <hi>Pererius</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">In Joan. c. 6. Diſp. 16. num. 48.</note>, who reckons theſe Nine diſtinct Miracles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſame Chriſt remaining in Heaven, not departing thence, and without any local mutation, is really and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor is he thus there only in one conſecrated Hoſt, but is together in all Hoſts conſecrated throughout the whole Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Tho' the Body of Chriſt in the Sacrament has all its Quantity and Colour, and other ſenſible Qualities; yet as it is in the Sacrament, it is neither there</hi> viſibly <hi>nor</hi> quantita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
<note n="*" place="margin">Quantum ad ſitum, &amp; extenſionem ejus ad locum.</note> 
               <hi>as to its</hi> ſitus, <hi>and extenſion unto Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Tho' the Body of Chriſt be in it ſelf greater than a Conſecrated Hoſt, yet according to the</hi> (Eſſe) <hi>Being it has there, it is whole in that Hoſt; nor only whole in the whole conſecrated Hoſt, but alſo whole in every part thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>If thoſe Accidents of the Conſecrated Hoſt be corrupted, and it ſhould happen that of them Worms or any other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal be generated, there is a great Miracle in their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For either the</hi> Materia prima <hi>is created anew, out of which the ſubſtantial Form of thoſe Animals is produced, as many Divines now think; or, according to S.</hi> Thomas, <hi>which ſeems to be a greater Miracle, The Quantity that was of the Conſecrated Hoſt, ſupplies the place of the</hi> Materia prima, <hi>and in it is produced the ſubſtantial Form of thoſe Animals which are generated from thence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The very Converſion of Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which is properly called by Divines</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>is a great Miracle; for ſuch a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation is found in no other thing, and is beſides all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Courſe of Nature, and can be made by no Created Power, but by God's Omnipotency alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>The Manner by which ſuch Tranſubſtantiation is made, is not without a Miracle; for it is made by the Words of Conſecration, pronounced rightly, and, as it ought, by a Prieſt. Therefore, as naturally ſuppoſing the laſt diſpoſition in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to produce the Form of Fire, the Form of Fire is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64618:9"/>produced in that Matter: So the Words of Conſecration being pronounced by the Prieſt, Chriſt himſelf is infallibly in that Conſecrated Hoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>After Conſecration, the whole Subſtance of Bread and Wine ceaſing to be, yet their Accidents do not ceaſe, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main: Neither do they remain inhering in any other Subject, but</hi> (per ſe exiſtunt) <hi>exiſt by themſelves, which is truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides and above the Nature of Accidents, whoſe</hi> eſſe (as the Schools ſay) <hi>is</hi> ineſſe, <hi>becauſe they can neither be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced nor remain naturally without a Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Laſtly, Thoſe Accidents of the Conſecrated Hoſt, tho' without the Subſtance of Bread and Wine, yet have the ſame natural Virtue which Bread and Wine had before Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> viz. <hi>the Virtue of nouriſhing, encreaſing, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Body of the Perſon that receives it; when yet Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition is made by converſion of the Subſtance of the Food in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Subſtance of the Living Creature.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. VI. The Sixth Difference. <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome (<hi>ſuitably to the ſtrange Doctrine it teaches about Chriſt's Body and Blood) teaches us not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Report our Senſes make, That the Subſtance of Bread and Wine remain in the Sacrament; but to paſs a contrary Judgment to what they inform us herein. But the Fathers teach the contrary, That we may ſecurely relie upon the Evidence of our Senſes, as to any Body, even as to the true Body of Chriſt.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THat the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> would not have us in this Matter to attend to the Evidence of Senſe, is needleſs to prove, ſince nothing is more common than to hear them call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to diſtruſt them, and to believe againſt their Report. Thus the <hi>Trent Catechiſm</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">

<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ib. n.</hi> 46. Corpus &amp; ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Domini ita ſumimus, ut tamen quod verè ſit, ſenſibus percipi non poteſt.</note>, <hi>We ſo receive the Body and Blood of Chriſt, that yet we cannot perceive by our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that it is truly ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Fathers,</hi> they are Strangers to this Doctrine, nor did they betray the Chriſtian Cauſe in this manner, by taking away all Certainty from the Teſtimony of our Senſes. They, on the contrary, proved the Truth of Chriſt's Body againſt the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> the <hi>Marcionites,</hi> and other Hereticks, by this Argument, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> rejects; they made their Appeals frequently (as S. <hi>John</hi> had done before them) to what had been ſeen with Mens Eyes, to what their Ears had heard, and their Hands had handled, without any ſuſpicion of their being deceived.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Irenaeus
<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>adv. Haereſ. c.</hi> 20. Hoc autem &amp; illis occurrit, qui dicunt eum putativè paſſum: Si enim non verè paſſus eſt, nulla gratia ei, cùm nulla fuerit paſſio.

Et quemadmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum illos ſeduxit, ut videretur ipſe hoc quod non erat, &amp; nos. ſeducit adhortans perferre ea quae ipſe non pertulit.</note>. This meets with them who ſay, That Chriſt ſuffered only ſeemingly. For if he did not truly ſuffer, no Thanks are due to him, when there was no Paſſion. And when he ſhall begin truly to ſuffer, he will ſeem a Seducer, when he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64618:24"/>exhorts us to ſuffer Stripes, and to turn the other Cheek, if he firſt did not ſuffer this in truth. And as he ſeduced them, in ſeeming to be that which he was not; ſo he ſeduces us, whilſt he exhorts us to ſuffer the things which he did not ſuffer.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. VIII. The Eighth Difference. <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in all Sayings of the Fathers-that mention a Change and Converſion in the Euchariſt, underſtand it of ſuch a Change as aboliſhes the Subſtance of Bread and Wine, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents only remaining: But the Fathers never uſe theſe Phraſes in this Senſe.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is acknowledged by us, That the Fathers ſpeak fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of a Change of the Bread and Wine, and their paſſing into, and being converted into Chriſt's Body and Blood. It is needleſs therefore to cite their Teſtimonies to this purpoſe; but I ſhall evidently prove, that they do not underſtand this <hi>Change</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> in the Senſe of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</p>
            <p>To give ſome Order to their Teſtimonies, I ſhall not cite them in a heap, but as Proofs of ſeveral Aſſertions of theirs, which overthrow the Change by Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Aſſertion. The Fathers make a difference betwixt the Change or Converſion of a Thing, and its Abolition.</hi> When they <hi>affirm</hi> the one, they at the ſame time <hi>deny</hi> the other. But Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation ſuppoſes the Elements, as to the Matter and Subſtance of them, to periſh and to be deſtroyed, when they are ſaid to be changed.</p>
            <p>You cannot well imagine that the <hi>Fathers,</hi> if they thought of Miracles wrought in the Sacrament, yet ſhould ever dream of any ſuch as had no agreement with all the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that God ever wrought before. They well knew, (and our Adverſaries do not deny it) that in all other Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Changes, there was only the introducing of a new Form, the <hi>Materia ſubſtrata</hi> (the common Matter) remaining. So it was when <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod was turned into a Serpent, when the Waters were turned into Blood, <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife into a Pillar of Salt, the Wine in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee</hi> changed into Water; in all theſe, neither the old Matter was loſt, nor new Matter created. The <hi>Fathers</hi> therefore laugh at any ſuch Change where the Things changed utterly periſh.</p>

            </p>
            <p>He has many ſmart Sayings againſt them, for denying the ſame Bodies to appear and riſe at the Reſurrection; and urges that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. ſhewing that there will be a Change, not a Deſtruction of our Fleſh. For, ſays he,
<note place="margin">Aliud eſt demutatio, aliud perditio. Peribit autem demu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tata, ſi non ipſa permanſerit in demutatione quae exhibita fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in reſurrectione.</note> 
               <hi>A Change is one thing, and Deſtruction is another. But it will periſh in the Change, if that Fleſh do not remain in the Change which ſhall be exhibited at the Reſurrection.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>The Fathers (as I have before proved, ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 4. <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2.) look upon the <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> in the Euchariſt as the <hi>Repreſentative Body</hi> of Chriſt; and thus Chriſt's Body is indeed preſent by that which is its <hi>Proxy</hi> or <hi>Pledge:</hi> But this Preſence in a proper ſenſe is Abſence, and does ſuppoſe it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore here only inſiſt upon one Conſideration of Chriſt's Body there, which can only agree to his <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative Body,</hi> but not to the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Glorified Body of Chriſt.</hi> Viz.</p>

                  <hi>The Preſence of Chriſt's Body in the Euchariſt, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpeak of, is of his Body as crucified, and ſlain, and dead.</hi> Now this cannot agree to his <hi>Natural Body,</hi> which, by our
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64618:58"/>Adverſaries Confeſſion is impaſſible and invulnerable now it is glorified, and cannot admit any ſeparation of Parts, which Crucifixion do's ſuppoſe, nor die any more.

For tho' I ſhould grant (which yet I ſee not ſufficiently cleared by him) that generally the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> alſo, did believe, that Chriſt had a Body, after the Reſurrection, of the ſame Subſtance, tho' differing in Qualities, from what he had before; yet there are Three things that he has by no means ſaid any thing material to, in his Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he has given no Account of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s ſtudious declining to determine any thing in particular about the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64618:62"/>Blood of Chriſt, when he had never ſo fair an occaſion to do it; but waves this always, even where he ſeems, as he do's in his <hi>Retractations,</hi> to determine for his having palpable Fleſh and Bones.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſhould ever at all doubt or heſitate about this Matter of Chriſt's Blood after his Reſurrection, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable, if he, with the reſt of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> had ſuch a conſtant Belief of its Preſence in the Euchariſt, as the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> affirm.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That tho' the <hi>Fathers</hi> uſe the Argument of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt to prove the Truth of Chriſt's Body, yet none ever ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Origen</hi> or his <hi>Followers</hi> with an Argument from thence, to confute their Opinions, differing from the pretended com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sentiments about the Body and Blood of Chriſt, by what lay ſo plainly before them, of his Body and Blood being in the Euchariſt, if they had believed it. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader to <hi>Monſieur Allix</hi> his Diſſertation, before-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, wherein he may find abundant Satisfaction in theſe Matters; and alſo will ſee how ſadly the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are put to it, to anſwer the Difficulties about the Blood of Chriſt, which they pretend to ſhew in ſo many Churches, and is produced in ſuch Quantities, that may well cauſe a new Doubt, Whether if his Reſurrection-Body have any Blood in it, we muſt not ſuppoſe it to be of a <hi>new Creation,</hi> ſince what was in his Body when he died, cannot ſuffice to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh more Blood, if ſo much, as their Vials and Glaſſes are filled withal.</p>

                  <hi>Whence it appears,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that this Body and Blood of Chriſt are the Pledge and Image of ſomething to come, which is now only repreſented, but ſhall hereafter be plainly exhibited. — therefore it is one thing which is now celebrated, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which ſhall hereafter be manifeſted.</hi> And afterwards (p. 115.) <hi>The Prayer ſays, that theſe things are celebrated in a Figure, not in Truth, that is, by way of ſimilitude (or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation) not the manifestation of the thing it ſelf. Now the Figure and the Truth are very different things: Therefore the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which is celebrated in the Church, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the Body and Blood of Christ which is glorified ſince the Reſurrection,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>We ſee how vast a difference there is between the myſtery of Christs Body and Blood which the faithful now receive in the Church,
<note place="margin">

For this Body which we celebrate in our way (to happineſs) muſt be ſpiritually received; for Faith believes ſomewhat that it ſees not; and it ſpiritually feeds the Soul, makes glad the heart, and confers Eternal Life and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption, if we attend not to that which feeds the Body, which is chew'd with our teeth, and ground in pieces, but to that which is ſpiritually received by Faith.

               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:64618:77"/>It is very obſervable, and a great confirmation of what has been ſaid in this Chapter, That the Ancient Chriſtians of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> inhabiting the Mountains of <hi>Malabar</hi> in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> agree with the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> in denying our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours <hi>Corporal Preſence</hi> in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt; as appears from their <hi>Publick Offices,</hi> and other Books, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a <hi>Synod</hi> which was celebrated amongſt them by <hi>Dom Aleixo de Menezes</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Goa,</hi> in the Year 1599.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The Book of <hi>Timothy</hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> is condemned, for aſſerting through three Chapters, that the true Body of Chriſt our Lord is not in the Sacrament of the Altar, but only the Figure of his Body.</p>

            <p>IT is poſſible this Argument may have as good an effect to open Mens Eyes, as any I have urged before, tho', I think, I have urged very cogent ones. For tho' ſome Men have a Faculty eternally to wrangle about the Words and Sayings of others, and to ſhift off an Argument of that kind, yet they cannot ſo eaſily get rid of an Objection from Matter of Fact, and a plain Practice. I ſhall therefore try, by ſeveral Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Uſages and Forbearances, in the caſes above-named, whether we may not ſee as clearly as if we had a Window into their Breaſts, that the Ancient Church, and the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were of different Minds and Opinions in this Matter.</p>

It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the Stream of the contrary Cuſtom, made it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to remove that at once, notwithſtanding this danger of effuſion of the Blood, which they had been wont in all

            <p>One was the Device of <hi>Intinction,</hi> or ſteeping the Bread in the Wine, and thus receiving both at once, which as Card. <hi>Cuſanus</hi> informs us

            <p>But now, after all, what account can we give of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers?</hi> they apprehended it neceſſary to receive in both Kinds in all their <hi>Publick Communions,</hi> and ſo they practiſed.

Truly, for my part, I am inclined to have as great, if not a greater opinion of them, in both reſpects, (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their <hi>Devotion</hi>) than I can have of the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> and I am the more perſwaded hereto, becauſe the Apoſtles themſelves muſt come in to the ſide of the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> their practice being the ſame: not to inſiſt upon the <hi>Deference</hi> that ought to be paid to that <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> that we are ſure acted <hi>them;</hi> who if there had been any ſuch real danger of propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by receiving in both kinds, or ever was likely to be any ſuch, would not have failed to have given directions <hi>to them</hi> how they ſhould avoid it; and we cannot think the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles would not have ſet down thoſe Directions <hi>to us</hi> in ſome of their Writings. But they have not done it; no not the Zealous St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who yet ſays ſo much to the careleſs <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> about this Argument, and tells them, that <hi>they came together, not for the better, but the worſe;</hi> charges them with unworthy receiving, and being <hi>thereby guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord,</hi> (1 Cor. 11.) and that <hi>for this cauſe many were weak and ſick among them,</hi> and were <hi>judged of the Lord</hi> for their prophanations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is none of the Charges againſt them, nor does he direct them to any of the wiſe Methods of the Roman Church for preventing this Danger;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64618:95"/>tho' he ſays, What he received of the Lord he delivered to them.</p>
            <p>There is nothing then remains, but that we aſſign the true Cauſe of this different Practice; which can be none other, but the Roman Churches <hi>innovating in their Faith</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sacrament, and altering ſo their Opinions about the Body and Blood of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a different Conduct for their Devotion; ſo that neither the Practice of the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> nor the Rules of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> will ſuit and agree with their Perſwaſions and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. But now the Faith of the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> in this Matter was ſuch, as neither requires nor can admit of any Alteration like what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has made in communicating the People only in one Kind. For, as I have before proved, they look'd upon this Sacrament, not as an actual Exhibition and Preſentation of the Natural and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Body of our Saviour, which they believed to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and contained in the Heavens, but as a Repreſentation of his Crucified Body, where his Blood was ſeparated from his Body, and poured out of his Veins; and that not only the <hi>Elements,</hi> but the <hi>Sacramental Actions</hi> of breaking the Bread, and pouring out the Wine, and our eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were inſtituted to ſhew forth this painful Death of our Lord, and the ſhedding of his moſt precious Blood for the Remiſſion of Sins.</p>
            <p>By the preſence of his <hi>glorified Body</hi> there, (as the Roman Church believes) this cannot be done, no breaking, nor no parts to be made of that, nor no ſeparation of Blood, as out of the Body. But all can be done in the <hi>Repreſentative Body</hi> of Chriſt, which is the Euchariſt, all the Ends of the Inſtitution can be there fully effected, and the Sacrifice on the Croſs, in this Image of it, made preſent to our Faith, and to our Minds, and ſet livelily before us; and by the Effects of this upon our Hearts, while we partake of the Elements, through the powerful Grace of God's Holy Spirit, we may be prepared to receive all the Bleſſed Fruits and Benefits of his Paſſion.</p>
            <p>According to theſe Perſwaſions, it's plain, there can be no abatement of communicating in the Cup; becauſe, without that, there is no repreſentation of a Crucified Body; for the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64618:95"/>diſtinct partaking of the Blood, (not as ſuppoſed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and received in the other Species) is that which alone ſhows (as I ſaid before) the ſeparation that was then made of his Body and Blood.</p>

            <p>Another Practice of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> differing from the <hi>Ancient,</hi> is, <hi>The Elevation of the Euchariſt, that all preſent may at once adore it.</hi> For thus the Miſſal

            <p>It is certain then, that the Roman Practice (when for Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they elevate and ſhow the Hoſt) is an Innovation; and that it proceeded from the Novel Doctrines then ſet on foot in the church, is highly probable; not only becauſe they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced about the ſame time; but alſo becauſe their practice ſuits ſo exactly with, and ſprings ſo freely from thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, it being ſo natural, when ſuch a glorious Body as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's is believed to be made preſent where it was not before, to be wholly taken up with thoughts of Adoration and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip above any thing elſe; as it is notoriouſly true in this Church, where the main End of the Euchariſt, <hi>viz:</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64618:96"/>in the Body and Blood of Chriſt is ſtrangely neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; and they are more concerned, in carrying the Sacrament in Proceſſions, in praying to it before their Altars, in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſplendid Tabernacles where it may repoſe, decking and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning the places of its Reſidence, and the like, than in engaging Men to <hi>receive it;</hi> which was the main thing the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> deſigned, that they might worthily partake of it; and when this was not deſigned, their way was wholly to conceal it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Inſtance.</p>
            <p>Another Practice of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> different from that of the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> is, that <hi>now the Communicants Hands are unimployed in receiving the Euchariſt; and all is put by the Prieſt into their mouths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Hands indeed may bear a part in their Adoration and ſhowing ſome Signs of that, but otherwiſe they are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. For now ſince Chriſt's Body is believed to lie hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Species of Bread and Wine, that is thought too ſacred to be touched by the Hands of any, but the Prieſts. We may therefore conclude fairly, that if the Fathers had not <hi>this care</hi> to forbid this touching by the Peoples Hands, they had not <hi>this Faith</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> that the Natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt is in the Euchariſt: ſince if this had been their Opinion, in all probability their practice would have been the ſame, Since that they had an equal concern for their Saviour's Honour, cannot well be doubted of.</p>
            <p>Now that <hi>they</hi> gave the Sacrament into the Peoples Hands, for the ſpace of eight hundred Years or more, is clear by their Teſtimonies. Of which I'll mention only three or four out of an hundred that might be given.</p>

            <p>And that this Cuſtom continued long in the Church, may be concluded from hence, That <hi>Baronius</hi> can find no earlier prohibition of it, than that of the <hi>Council of Rhemes,</hi> which he ſays was held in the Days of <hi>Charles the Great.</hi> I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the Commendation he adds of this Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, (being concerned only in the Matter of Fact) ſaying, That it was very <hi>laudable;</hi> but I do not think it was ſo meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his Reaſon, <hi>[ob periculum quod immineret materiae fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gili]</hi> becauſe of <hi>the imminent danger in ſuch brittle Matter.</hi> For if the Cuſtom was as ancient as the Apoſtles, how came they to want that quick Senſe the <hi>Roman Church</hi> now has to prevent that Danger?

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64618:98"/>Language of the Fathers, giving it the name of <hi>Chriſt's Blood;</hi> but it's not poſſible to believe that they who thus uſed it, thought it to be ſo, any otherwiſe than by repreſentation: ſince you can hardly think of a higher profanation, by any mixture, than this, of blending the true Blood of Chriſt with Ink, unleſs I except the caſe of mixing it with Poiſon, for the deſtruction of Perſons; and thus <hi>P.

            <p>Taking it therefore for granted, that no Body will have the confidence to aſſert, that they who thus mixed it with Ink, did believe Tranſubſtantiation, I ſhall now ſet down three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Inſtances of a Pope, a General Council, and a King, that thus uſed it.</p>
            <p>The firſt is of Pope <hi>Theodorus,</hi> who as <hi>Theophanes</hi> (whoſe words <hi>Baronius</hi>

            <p>Concerning which, for methods ſake, I ſhall refer all to three remarkable differences.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Difference.] <hi>What was not received in the Euchariſt by the Communicants, the Ancient Church took no care to reſerve it; But the new Roman Church reſerves all publickly that is unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and puts little of it to any uſes that are Sacramental.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not ſay that there was no reſervation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, after the Euchariſt was over, of what had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, and not received, even before the Innovations took place, which were introduced by the Roman Church, becauſe there may perhaps be ſome Inſtances given of communicating the Sick out of ſuch Remains; and among the <hi>Greeks</hi> there was alſo communicating, <hi>ex praeſanctificatis,</hi> of what had been conſecrated before; but theſe, I ſay, were but later Cuſtoms of the 6th and 7th Centuries, and both before and after the contrary Cuſtom did prevail; and where theſe Reſervations were, they employed them to the ends of the Sacrament, for to be <hi>eaten</hi> and not to be <hi>adored.</hi>

Theſe admirable Caſuiſts, you ſee, determine againſt communicating the dying Perſon, when it could not be performed with the <hi>majeſtick Ceremonies</hi> they deſired.</p>
            <p>The Prieſt of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the Fathers in <hi>China,</hi> differ very widely in their Practice, and you may be ſure their Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in this matter were as different; the Man himſelf indeed, he tells us, found a way to get the Communion at laſt, by throwing himſelf into <hi>their Houſe,</hi> but it was not till they had made a little Proceſſion within doors; till the Tapeſtry was ſpread on the Floors, and the Tapers lighted, nothing could be done.</p>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64618:101"/>reſpects paid to it by Beaſts, what he expected much more from Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Difference,</hi> relates to what was received in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt; wherein we alſo ſee a plain diſagreement in the uſages of the <hi>Primitive,</hi> and the <hi>preſent Roman Church.</hi> Which is this; The <hi>Ancient Church allowed great Liberty privately to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what had been publickly received in the Euchariſt: Which would be now a great Crime in the Roman Church;</hi> ſo far from being allowed.</p>

            <p>The laſt Inſtance of differing Practices in the two Churches, ſhall be, <hi>In their over-ſollicitouſneſs to prevent any Accidents that might happen in the Adminiſtration of the Euchariſt; their Frights when any ſuch thing do's happen, and the Expiations required for negligence to purge ſuch Crimes; ſuch as we have no foot-ſteps of in any of thoſe caſes, in the Ancient Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt of thoſe Caſes, I have ſomewhat prevented my ſelf, in what I before have ſhown, of their Devices of <hi>Intinction,</hi> ſucking the Sacrament <hi>through Pipes;</hi> and, which is worſt of all (out of this abundant caution) <hi>denying the People the Cup.</hi> Here therefore I ſhall mention <hi>other Cautions,</hi> ſuch as thoſe which tend to prevent any <hi>Fragments</hi> falling off
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64618:103"/>from the <hi>Bread of the Euchariſt,</hi> that no <hi>Crumbs</hi> may have any diſhonour done to them, by being left unregarded, but either may be received or reſerved.</p>
            <p>To this end, they have altered the <hi>Ancient Cuſtom</hi> of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding <hi>common Bread,</hi> ſuch as is of ordinary uſe, for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and required that it be <hi>unleavened,</hi> becauſe this is leſs apt to break into <hi>Crumbs,</hi> and cleaves better together in its Parts. And tho' they do not ſay that there is no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where leavened Bread is uſed, yet the <hi>Miſſal</hi>

They have alſo invented, about the ſame Time, and ſtill uſe, thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>round Wafers</hi> (as they are commonly called) which is that which they conſecrate for the Bread of the Sacrament, and take care hereby to prevent breaking into <hi>Crumbs;</hi> for they never break them for diſtribution, but put them whole into the Communicants Mouths; whereas the <hi>Ancient Practice</hi> was, to provide one whole Loaf of Subſtantial Bread, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide this into parts, and break it for to be diſtributed among them all. But theſe <hi>Hoſtiolae,</hi> little Hoſts, are brought to ſuch a tenuity, that they are the next door to what they call <hi>ſpecies,</hi> having ſcarce any ſubſtance, and <hi>deſerve not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> the name of Bread, as a learned Man

            <p>It is eaſy to ſhow, that all this caution to prevent <hi>falling Crumbs,</hi> is perfect nonſenſe, according to their principles, ſince the True Body of Chriſt cannot be broken or crumbled into Bits, which is the only ſubſtance remaining; the reſt, which they call <hi>Species,</hi> being Mathematical Lines and Colours only, and no matter under them; a <hi>whole World</hi> of them can never make up a <hi>Crumb of Bread,</hi> or any Fragment.

When the Prieſt that celebrates do's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelf, it is then only that he breaks the Hoſt into three parts, one of which he puts into the Cup; and after he has taken the other two which are upon the <hi>Patin,</hi> he is directed

               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:64618:104"/>In the laſt Chapter I have given the Reader ſome Inſtances of thoſe ſtrange Things, and will here only add two Caſes which the Roman Miſſal provides for.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, <hi>If a Conſecrated Hoſt, or any part of it, ſhould fall to the Ground,</hi> the direction is
<note n="(g)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Miſſal. Ram. de defect.

If it fell without the Corporal upon the Napkin</hi> (Mappam) <hi>or any ways upon any Linen Cloth, ſuch Napkin, or Linen, muſt be carefully waſhed, and that Water poured out into the Holy Repoſitory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Caſe is, <hi>When by negligence

                     <hi>Ibid. c.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12.</note> any thing of the Blood is Spilt. If it fell upon the Earth, or upon a Board, it muſt be licked up with the Tongue, and the place ſcraped ſufficiently, and ſuch ſcraping be burnt, and the Aſhes laid up in the Repoſitory. But if it fell upon the Altar-ſtone, the Prieſt muſt ſup up the Drop, and the place be well waſhed, and that water caſt into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory. If it fell upon the Altar-Cloths, and the Drop ſunk as far as the ſecond or third Cloth, thoſe Cloths muſt be thrice wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed where the Drop fell, putting the Cup underneath</hi> to receive the Water, <hi>and that Water thrown into the foreſaid place.</hi> And ſo it directs to ſuch waſhing when it falls upon the Corporal alone, or the Prieſt's Garments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but here annex alſo the Conſtitution which the Reader may find in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to the <hi>Hiſtory of the Church of Peterburgh,</hi> Pag. 344. (being the firſt of two there ſet down) directing what is to be done, when any negligence happens about the Lord's Body and Blood, and how to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Crime.</p>
            <q>
               <p>When there is ſo great negligence about the Lord's Body and Blood, that it happens to fall downward, or into any place where it cannot be fully perceived, whether it fell, and whether any of it came to the Ground; Let the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be diſcovered as ſoon as may be to the Abbot or Prior, who taking ſome of the Friars with him, let him come to the place where this has happened; And if the Body ſhall have fallen, or the Blood have been ſpilt upon Stone, or Earth, or Wood, or Mat, or Tapeſtry, or ſuch like, let the duſt of the Earth be gathered, part of that Stone be ſcraped, part of that Wood, Mat, Tapeſtry, or the like,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64618:105"/>be cut away and caſt into the Holy Repoſitory. But if the place where it is thought chiefly to have fallen, let there be the like gathering, Scraping, cutting away, and caſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holy Repoſitory. Then they by whoſe negligence this has happened in the next Chapter ſhall humbly declare their Fault, and on their naked Bodies receive Judgment <hi>(judicium nudi ſuſcipiant)</hi> and Penance be enjoined them, either of Faſting, or Whipping, or Rehearſing ſo many Pſalms, or ſuch like. Which Perſons going back to their places, from their Puniſhment <hi>(de judicio)</hi> all the prieſts then preſent ſhall riſe up, and with all devotion offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to receive Puniſhment. Then he that holds the Chapter, ſhall detain ſeven of them, which he pleaſes to chuſe, to receive the Judgment (of <hi>whipping</hi>) and command the reſt to go away. The Chapter being ended, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating themſelves together, ſhall ſay ſeven Penitential Pſalms in the Monaſtery, beginning to ſing them as they go out from the Chapter. Then ſhall follow after the Pſalms, the <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> with theſe Chapters and Collects. <hi>Let thy Mercy, O Lord, be upon us. Remember not our Iniquities.</hi> The Lord be with you. Let us pray. <hi>Hear, O Lord, our Prayers, and Spare the Sins of thoſe that confeſs themſelves to thee; that they whoſe guilty Conſciences do accuſe them, thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Pardon may abſolve them.</hi> Or that other Collect. <hi>O God, whoſe property is always to have Mercy;</hi> or ſuch other collect for Sirs.</p>
               <p>But if the Blood fell upon the Corporal, or upon any clean Cloth, and it be certain whether it fell, let that part of the Cloth be waſhed in ſome Chalice, and the firſt Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was waſh'd in be drunk off by the Friars; the other two waſhings be caſt into the Repoſitory. The ſaid Fault muſt be diſcovered in the firſt Chapter, but they alone, by whoſe negligence this has happened, ſhall receive the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Diſcipline, but all the Friars ſhall ſay over in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery all the ſeven Pſalms, with the Chapters and Collects, as was ſaid before. If that day, the ſhort one for the Dead ſhall be read in the Chapter, let them firſt ſing my words going into the Church: After that the ſeven Pſalms, as
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64618:105"/>aforeſaid. But if in any other manner a lighter negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſhall happen relating to this Sacrament, the Friar, by whoſe Fault it happened, ſhall be puniſhed with a ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Revenge at the diſcretion of the Abbot or Prior.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus I have given a ſufficient Specimen of the ſtrange Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Fears the Roman Church are under, leſt any thing ſhould happen, even to the very leaſt Particle or Drop of the Sacrament, that is diſhonourable: And indeed, their Caution is very agreeable to their Perſwaſions, as I have before often hinted.</p>
            <p>But now if we turn our Eyes upon the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> tho' we cannot queſtion, either their Devotion or reverent Behaviour in all Acts of Religious Worſhip, and particularly in this great One; yet there is not to be found any ſuch <hi>ſcrupuloſities</hi> about <hi>minute things;</hi> nor ſuch <hi>frightful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> in the caſe of unforeſeen Accidents, nor ſuch <hi>Expiations</hi> as we have before heard of. They did not forbear to uſe the <hi>Common Bread</hi> (as I ſaid before) tho' it might be more lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to crumble; they took their Share from one <hi>Common Loaf;</hi> they received the Wine without <hi>intinction,</hi> or <hi>ſucking it through Pipes,</hi> &amp;c. Which are all later Inventions, ſince the Faith was innovated concerning the Euchariſt.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this is only a Negative Argument, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore add a Poſitive one, to demonſtrate that the <hi>Ancients</hi> were far from theſe Scrupuloſities; and alſo that they came into the Church with Tranſubſtantiation, and not before; <hi>viz. The Practice of Communicating Infants.</hi> It is not my Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here to prove, that this was the common Uſage in the Church, from the Times of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> at leaſt, even to later Ages, which has been done effectually by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64618:106"/>that Epiſtle of P. <hi>Paſchal</hi> 2. (which I mentioned in another Chapter) given us by <hi>Baronius,</hi> at the end of his <hi>laſt Tome,</hi> (<hi>Ad Ann.</hi> 1118. when that Pope died) wherein he forbids <hi>Intinction</hi> of the Bread in the Wine, and requires that the Bread and Wine ſhould be <hi>taken ſeparately;</hi> gives us alſo this exception, (<hi>praeter in parvulis ac omnino infirmis qui panem ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbere non poſſunt</hi>) that <hi>it may be allowed to little Children, and thoſe extreamly weak, that cannot get down the Bread:</hi> Which had been a needleſs proviſion for them, if Infants had not then received the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>This being then a certain and confeſſed thing, that Infants received the Euchariſt, I refer it to the Conſcience of any <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> whether he can think the <hi>Ancients</hi> had any of their aforeſaid Fears, and nice Scrupuloſities, about the Accidents that might happen to the conſecrated Elements, which in that Practice could not be prevented; it being impoſſible, where ſucking Children receive either Bread or Wine, to hinder the happening of ſomething which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will call highly diſhonourable to the Sacrament.

            </p>
            <p>All theſe Prayers I have cited, the Reader muſt remember are <hi>after Conſecration;</hi> upon which immediately, according to the preſent Faith of the Roman Church, the Subſtance of Bread and Wine is deſtroyed, and nothing but the Species and Shadows of them remain; and now Chriſt, inſtead of them, becomes preſent there in his Body, and Soul, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. This is their Faith. But it is impoſſible to reconcile this to thoſe foregoing Prayers. For at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Canon,</hi> they pray,
<note n="*" place="margin">Supplices rogamus ac pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus uti accepta habeas &amp; benedicas, haec dona, haec munera, haec ſancta ſacrificia illibata.</note> That <hi>God would accept and bleſs theſe Donations and Gifts, theſe holy undefiled Sacrifices;</hi> that is, the Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Bread and Wine, which are no more than ſo, till the words of Conſecration.</p>
            <p>After this (as you heard) they pray, That <hi>this Oblation may be made to us, the Body and Blood of thy dear Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Which do not imply a change of Subſtances; for thoſe words <hi>(fiat nobis) be made to us,</hi> may very well conſiſt with the Oblations remaining in Subſtance what they were before, only beging the Communication of the Virtue and Efficacy of Chriſt's Paſſion to themſelves.</p>
            <p>And that this is the ſenſe of the <hi>Canon,</hi> appears by thoſe words after Conſecration, when they ſay, <hi>We offer to thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty a pure Sacrifice of thy Donations and Gifts.</hi> Which words
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64618:108"/>plainly ſuppoſe, that they are in Nature what they were, <hi>God's Creatures</hi> ſtill, not the appearance and ſhadow of them only. But they call them now the <hi>Bread of Eternal Life, and the Cup of Salvation;</hi> becauſe, after they are bleſſed and made Sacraments, they are not now to be look'd upon as bodily Food, but as the Food of our Souls, as repreſenting that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, and his Paſſion, which is the Bread of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Life.</p>
            <p>If they had underſtood nothing to remain now after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, but Chriſt's <hi>Natural Body,</hi> they would not have called this <hi>thy Gifts</hi> in the Plural Number, but expreſſed it in the Singular, <hi>thy Gift.</hi> Neither can they refer to the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Accidents, becauſe they are no <hi>real Things,</hi> and rather tell us what God has <hi>taken away,</hi> (the whole Subſtance of them) than what he has given.</p>
            <p>But then what follows, puts it out of all doubt
<note n="*" place="margin">Supra quae propitio ac ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reno vultu reſpicere digne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</note>; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which</hi> (ſtill in the Plural) <hi>look pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiouſly.</hi> If it had been, <hi>Look upon us propitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ſake of Chriſt,</hi> it had been well enough. Or, to deſire of God to look <hi>upon theſe things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiouſly which they offer;</hi> if they mean (as he that made the Prayer did) that God would accept this Oblation of Bread and Wine, as he did of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> (which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was indeed Bread and Wine) this had been very proper. But to make that which we offer to be Chriſt himſelf, (as they that believe Tranſubſtantiation muſt expound it) and to deſire God to look propitiouſly and benignly <hi>upon him,</hi> when there can be <hi>no fear</hi> that he ſhould ever be unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Father, nor none can be <hi>ſo fooliſh</hi> as to think that Chriſt ſtands in need of our recommendation to God for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, this ſenſe can never be agreeable to the Prayer.

            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:64618:109"/>Would it not run finely, to pray that God would be well pleaſed with Chriſt, for the honour of his Chriſt?</p>
            <p>But beſides the Petition, that God would look propitiouſly upon them, it follows in <hi>the Canon, That God would accept them, as he did the Gifts of</hi> Abel, <hi>and</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeck. How unagreeable is this (if Chriſt himſelf be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood here) to make the Compariſon for acceptance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Lamb and a Calf, or Bread and Wine, and Chriſt the Son of God, with whom he was always highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>But then what follows ſtill entangles Matters more in the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>'s Senſe. The Prayer, That God <hi>would command theſe things to be carried by the hands of his Holy Angel to the High Altar above.</hi> For how can the Body of Chriſt be carried by Angels to Heaven, which never left it ſince his Aſcenſion, but is always there?

            <p>The next Paſſage of the <hi>Canon</hi> increaſes ſtill the difficulty to them that believe Tranſubſtantiation. When it ſays, <hi>Through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, by whom, O Lord, thou doſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways create, ſanctify, quicken, bleſs and beſtow all theſe good things on us.</hi> If there be no good thing remaining in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt beſides Chriſt, when theſe words are ſaid, What Senſe or Truth is there in them? Can Chriſt, or his Body that already exiſts, be created anew, and be always created?
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64618:110"/>Can that be always <hi>ſanctified,</hi> that was never <hi>common?</hi> Or, is he to be raiſed and quickned anew daily, that once being ſo raiſed, can die no more? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that which makes the Abſurdity of this Interpretation the greater, is, that they ſay that all this is done <hi>to Chriſt by Chriſt</hi> himſelf; as if God <hi>by Chriſt</hi> did <hi>create Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>by Chriſt,</hi> did <hi>bleſs,</hi> and <hi>quicken,</hi> and <hi>ſanctify Chriſt;</hi> which none but he that is forſaken of common Senſe can affirm.</p>
            <p>The old Interpreters of the Canon made other work of it, and ſuppoſed that the <hi>Creatures of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered</hi> to God, <hi>remained Creatures</hi> ſtill; for thus the forecited <hi>Remigius</hi>

He</hi> ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>thoſe things ſo created and offered in his ſight, when the things that were a ſimple Creature, are made Sacraments: he</hi> quickens them, <hi>ſo that they become Myſteries of Life: He</hi> bleſſes them, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he heaps all Celeſtial Benediction and Grace on them. He</hi> beſtows them on us, <hi>by the ſame Chriſt ſanctifying them with him, who has given to us ſo wholſom a repaſt from his Body and Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What can be alſo more plain than the words of the next Prayer I mentioned, <hi>That what we have taken with our Mouth, may of a Temporal Gift be made an Eternal Remedy?</hi> Did ever any one call Chriſt a <hi>Temporal Gift,</hi> in diſtinction from an <hi>Eternal Remedy?</hi> Is it not certain that the <hi>Oblata,</hi> the things offered, are the <hi>Temporal Gift,</hi> which by our due receiving them, become eternally beneficial to us?</p>
            <p>The laſt Prayer alſo, which begs, That <hi>the Body and Blood of Chriſt may cleave to their Bowels or Entrals,</hi> cannot be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted of his <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>natural Body;</hi> ſince, as the Romaniſts confeſs, this Body can neither touch us, nor be touched by us, as it exiſts in the Sacrament, much leſs can <hi>cleave or ſtick</hi> to our Bodies. But the <hi>repreſentative</hi> Body of Chriſt may; and he that made this Petition firſt, ſeems to tell us his <hi>own Senſe,</hi> (tho' no very wiſe one) that he would not have this Holy Food to paſs through him, as other Meats did (and which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64618:110"/>many of the Ancients thought this alſo did) but might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main and be conſumed (as S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s phraſe is) with the Subſtance of his Body.</p>
            <p>Thus I think I have demonſtrated ſufficiently the firſt thing I aſſerted at the beginning of this Chapter, <hi>That the old Prayers in the Canon of the Maſs, concerning the Sacrament, agree not with the preſent Faith of the Roman Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed now to ſhew the other thing, That <hi>their New Prayers and Devotions to the Sacrament, have no countenance from the Ancient Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told the Reader before of their New Feſtival, which the <hi>Miſſal</hi> calls the <hi>Feaſt and Solemnity of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> They have ſuited all things anſwerably to it; <hi>New Prayers, New Hymns;</hi> and their allowed <hi>Books of Devotion,</hi> have an <hi>Office of the Bleſſed Sacrament,</hi> for one day of the Week, and a <hi>New Litany,</hi> &amp;c. Which I ſhall give now ſome account of, and tho' all of them are not direct Prayers to it, yet they are ſuch ſtrains concerning it, and in ſuch a new Stile, as has no old Example.

            <p>This is enough to ſhow into what ſtrains of Devotion the preſent <hi>Roman Church</hi> now runs, ſince Tranſubſtantiation is an Article of its Faith. I deny not that theſe Prayers are very natural if that Doctrine were true; and I would fain have a good Reaſon aſſigned, why, if this Doctrine was believed of old, this was not the way of the <hi>Primitive Devotion:</hi> If they affirm that it was, it lies upon them to produce the evidence. But then let me tell them before-hand, that we will not be ſhamm'd off with <hi>a Rhetorical Proſopopoeia</hi> of an Author, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of S. <hi>Denis the Areopagite</hi> (which has been the only thing I have ſeen alledged, and as often anſwered) whoſe Authority neither cannot be conſiderable to us, who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that he was firſt produced and ſhown to the World by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and rejected by the Orthodox.</p>

               </gap>f the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church with the preſent Roman Church, in their Faith and Opinions about the Euchariſt; when we ſhall find, that even our own <hi>Old Engliſh Church,</hi> that had received moſt of its Inſtructions in Chriſtianity from the Roman, and in many other things agreed with what it now profeſſes, yet in this widely differ'd from it.</p>
            <p>This plainly argues one of theſe two things, either that the <hi>then Roman Church,</hi> had not the Opinions of the preſent Church in theſe Matters and ſo did not propagate them to us; (which cannot be ſaid, when we remember the buſy Diſputes about theſe Matters in the 9th Century, tho' they were not yet come to a determination); or elſe, that when the Roman Church warped, and generally eſpouſed a New Doctrine which the Ancient Fathers were ſtrangers to, we ſtill kept our Ground, and did not ſuffer our ſelves to be perverted, but held to the Ancient Belief.</p>
            <p>This is the Truth of our Caſe, as appears by a noble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main of an <hi>Eaſter Sermon</hi> (about 700 Years old) in the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Tongue, among other Catholick Homilies that were to be read yearly in the Church, It was produced in the laſt Age in the Saxon with a Tranſlation in our Engliſh Tongue; (prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>John Day</hi>) it was fince put, with the ſame Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> into his Martyrology

            <p>The Eaſter Sermon begins thus:</p>
            <q>MEN Beloved, you have been often diſcourſed to, concerning our Saviour's Reſurrection, how he, after his Paſſion on this Day, roſe powerfully from the Dead. Now we ſhall, by God's Grace explain ſomething to you about the Holy Euchariſt, which this day we are bound to frequent, and inſtruct your underſtanding about this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, both according to the Old and New Teſtament, that no doubting may diſturb you concerning this Life-giving Banquet.—</q>
            <p>The Sermon goes on with an account of the Jewiſh Paſſover, and the Application of thoſe things to the Euchariſt, which I omit;</p>
            <q>— Chriſt, before his ſuffering, conſecrated Bread,
<note place="margin">P. 469.</note> and diſtributed it to his Diſciples, ſaying thus, <hi>Eat this Bread, it is my Body, and do this in remembrance of me:</hi> Alſo he Conſecrated Wine in a Cup, and ſaid, <hi>Drink ye all of this, This is my Blood which is ſhed for many for the Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> The Apoſtles did, as Chriſt commanded, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Bread and Wine for the Euchariſt. And to his memory alſo afterward every one of their Succeſſors, and all Chriſt's Prieſts, According to Chriſt's Command, by the Apoſtolical Benediction, did conſecrate Bread and Wine in his Name. Now Men have often diſputed,
<note place="margin">P. 470.</note> and do it ſtill, How that Bread which is prepared of Corn, and is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the heat of Fire, can be changed into Chriſt's Body; and how that Wine which is preſſed out of many Grapes, by any bleſſing of it, can be changed into our Lord's Blood? Now to ſuch Men, I anſwer, that ſome things are ſpoken of Chriſt <hi>by ſignification,</hi> ſome others by a <hi>known thing:</hi> It is a true thing, and known, that Chriſt was born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and voluntarily ſuffered Death, and was buried, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64618:115"/>this Day roſe from the Dead. He is called <hi>Bread,</hi> and a <hi>Lamb,</hi> and <hi>a Lion,</hi> and otherwiſe, by <hi>ſignification.</hi> He is called <hi>Bread,</hi> becauſe he is our Life, and the Life of Angels. He is called a <hi>Lamb,</hi> for his Innocency. A <hi>Lion,</hi> for his Strength, whereby he overcame the ſtrong Devil. Yet notwithſtanding, according to true Nature, Chriſt is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bread,</hi> nor a <hi>Lamb,</hi> nor a <hi>Lion.</hi> Wherefore then is that Holy Euchariſt called <hi>Chriſt's Body,</hi> or <hi>his Blood,</hi> if it be not truly what it is called? Truly the Bread and Wine, which are conſecrated by the Maſs of the Prieſts, ſhow one thing outwardly to Mens Senſes, and another thing they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare inwardly to believing Minds. Outwardly, Bread and Wine are ſeen both in appearance, and in taſt; yet they are truly after Conſecration Chriſt's Body and Blood, by <hi>a Spiritual Sacrament.</hi> An Heathen Child is Baptized, yet he altereth not his outward ſhape, though he be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged within. He is brought to the Font full of Sin through <hi>Adam's</hi> Diſobedience, but he is waſhed from all his Sins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, tho' he has not changed his outward Shape. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that Holy Font-Water, which is called the Well-ſpring of Life, is like in Nature <hi>(in ſpecie)</hi> to other Waters, and is ſubject to corruption; but the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, by the Prieſt's Bleſſing, comes upon that corruptible Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and after that, it can waſh both Body and Soul from all Sins,
<note place="margin">P. 471.</note> by ſpiritual Power. We ſee now in this one Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture two things: that, whereby, according to true Nature, it is corruptible Water, and that whereby, according to the Spiritual Myſtery, it has a ſaving Power. So alſo, if we look upon that Holy Euchariſt according to a corporeal Senſe, then we ſee that it is a Creature corruptible and changeable; but if we own a ſpiritual Power there, then we underſtand that Life is in it, and that it confers Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality on thoſe that taſt it by Faith. There is a great difference betwixt the inſible Vertue (and Power) of this Holy Euchariſt, and the viſible appearance of its proper Nature. By its Nature it is corruptible Bread, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Wine; and by the Virtue of the Divine Word, it is <hi>truly</hi> the Body and Blood of Chriſt; yet not <hi>corporally</hi> ſo, but <hi>ſpiritually.</hi> There is much differencce betwixt that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which Chriſt ſuffer'd in, and that Body which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64618:115"/>for the Euchariſt. The Body that Chrivt ſuffer'd in, was Born of the Fleſh of <hi>Mary,</hi> with Blood and Bones, with Skin and Nerves; animated by a rational Spirit in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Members: but his <hi>Spiritual Body,</hi> which we call the Euchariſt, is collected from many grains of Corn, without Blood and Bone, without Member or Soul: wherefore there is nothing in it to be underſtood <hi>Corporeally,</hi> but all is to be underſtood <hi>Spiritually.</hi> Whatſoever is in that Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt which reſtores Life to us, this is from Spiritual Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and from Inviſible Operation. Therefore that Holy Euchariſt is called a Sacrament, becauſe one thing is there ſeen, and another thing underſtood: that which is there ſeen has a <hi>bodily Nature,</hi> that which we underſtand in it has <hi>a ſpiritual Virtue.</hi> The Body of Chriſt, that ſuffered Death,
<note place="margin">P. 472.</note> and roſe from the Dead, henceforth dies no more, but is eternal and impaſſible. That Euchariſt is Temporary, not Eternal; it is corruptible, and capable of diviſion into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Parts; it is chewed with the Teeth, and ſent into the draught: yet it will be true, that <hi>according to ſpiritual Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> it is whole in every part: Many receive that Holy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet according to the ſpiritual Myſtery, it will be whole in every part. Tho' ſome receive a leſſer part of it, yet there will not be more virtue in the greater part than in the leſſer, becauſe it will be whole in all Men according to the inviſible virtue. This Sacrament is a <hi>Pledg,</hi> and a <hi>Type;</hi> the Body of Chriſt is <hi>the Truth:</hi> We keep this Pledg Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, till we come to the Truth it ſelf; and then is the Pledg at an end. It is indeed, as we ſaid before, Chriſt's Body and his Blood, but not <hi>Corporally,</hi> but <hi>Spiritually.</hi> Do not diſpute, how this can be effected, but believe it firmly, that ſo it is.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Here follow ſome idle Viſions, which that credulous Age were fond of, but are nothing to the purpoſe, and therefore I omit them.</hi>

            <p>
               <q>— <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the old Iſraelites writing thus in his Epiſtle to the Faithful.
<note place="margin">P. 473.</note> 
                  <hi>All our Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were baptized in the Cloud and in the Sea; and all ate the ſame ſpiritual Meat, and all drank the ſame ſpiritual Drink,

This he ſaid of the Holy Ghoſt, which they that Believed on him, ſhould receive.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael ate the ſame ſpiritual Meat, and drank the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Drink,</hi> becauſe the heavenly Food that fed them for forty Years, and that Water that flowed from the Rock, <hi>ſignified</hi> Chriſt's Body and Blood, which are now dayly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Church of God. It was the ſame which we offer to day, not <hi>corporally,</hi> but <hi>ſpiritually.</hi> We told you before, that Chriſt conſecrated Bread and Wine for the Euchariſt before his Paſſion, and ſaid, This is my Body, and my Blood: he had not yet ſuffered, and yet he changed, by his inviſible Power, that Bread into his Body, and that Wine into his Blood; as he did before in the Wilderneſs, before he was born Man, when he turned the heavenly Food into his Fleſh, and that Water flowing from the Rock into his Blood.
<note place="margin">P. 474.</note> Many Perſons ate of the Heavenly Food in the Deſart, and drank of the Spiritual Drink, and yet, as Chriſt ſaid, are dead. Chriſt meant not that Death which no Man can avoid, but he underſtood eternal Death, which ſeveral of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for their Unbelief, had deſerved. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and ſeveral others of the People that pleaſed God, ate that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bread, and did not die that everlaſting Death, tho' they died the common Death. They ſaw that the heavenly Food was viſible and Corruptible; but they underſtood that viſible thing <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> and they taſted <hi>it ſpiritually.</hi> Jeſus ſaid, <hi>Whoſo eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, hath Eternal Life:</hi> He did not command them to eat that Body which he had aſſumed, nor to drink that Blood which he ſhed for us; but by that Speech, he meant the Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, which is <hi>Spiritually</hi> his Body, and his Blood; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever taſteth this, with a believing Heart, ſhall have that Eternal Life. Under the old Law, the Faithful offered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Sacrifices to God, which had a future ſignification of the Body of Chriſt, which he hath offered in Sacrifice to his heavenly Father for our Sins. This Euchariſt which
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64618:116"/>is now conſecrated at God's Altar, is a Commemoration of the Body of Chriſt which he offered for us, and of his Blood which he ſhed for us: As he himſelf commanded, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> Chriſt once ſuffered by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but yet his Paſſion by the Sacrament of this Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, is daily renewed at the Holy Maſs.

            <head>CHAP. XVII. The CONCLUSION. <hi>That the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation has given a new occaſion to the Enemies of Chriſtian Religion to blaſpheme. It is ſo great a ſtumbling-block to the Jews, that their Converſion is hopeleſs, whilſt this is believed by them to be the Common Faith of Chriſtians. That tho' the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>will not hearken to us, yet they may be provoked to emulation by the Jews themſelves, who have given a better account of Chriſt's Words of Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and more agreeable to the Fathers, than this Church has; and raiſed unanſwerable Objections againſt its Doctrine.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAving conſidered, in the foregoing Chapters, the Senſe of the Ancient Church about Matters relating to the Euchariſt, and Tranſubſtantiation, from their own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; and found that their Aſſertions are inconſiſtent with the Belief of the preſent Roman Church; and that their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices are not to be reconciled thereunto. Having alſo made an Enquiry into the Ancient forms of Devotion, relating to the Euchariſt, remaining ſtill in this Church, and found them to ſpeak a Language, which has a Sence agreeing indeed with that of the Ancients, but no Sence at all, when the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tranſubſtantiation is ſuppoſed, and thoſe Prayers to be interpreted by it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now, for a Concluſion, take a view alſo of the principal Enemies of the Chriſtian Faith; which will afford a convincing Evidence, that the Roman Doctrine is Novel, and a ſtranger to the Ancient Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>It is ſufficiently known, that the Adverſaries of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity took all the occaſions poſſible, and whatſoever gave them any colour to reproach the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> of Chriſtians, and to make their Names odious. Nothing that looked ſtrange and abſurd in either, eſcaped, being taken notice of by ſuch as <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Porphyry, Lucian</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> among the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64618:119"/>Heathens, and ſuch as <hi>Trypho</hi> among the Jews. They curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly examined and ſurveyed what they taught and practiſed, and whatſoever they thought to be fooliſh and incredible, they, with all their wit and cunning, endeavoured to expoſe it. So, they did with the Doctrines of the <hi>Trinity, the Eternal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Son of God,</hi> his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> his <hi>Crucifixion</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, and <hi>our Reſurrection.</hi> Neither were they leſs praying into the Chriſtian <hi>Myſteries</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> which they could not be ignorant of, there being ſo many Deſerters and Apoſtates in thoſe Times of Perſecution, who were well acquainted with them; and by threatnings and fear of torment if there were any thing ſecret were likely to betray them. Not to inſiſt upon this, that the great Traducer of Chriſtians, I mean <hi>Julian,</hi> was himſelf once initiated in their Myſteries, and ſo could not be Ignorant of what any of them were; and has in particular laught at their Baptiſm, that Chriſtians ſhould fanſy a purgation thereby from Great Crimes.</p>
            <p>Yet, after all this, they took no occaſion from the Euchariſt to traduce them; tho, if Chriſtians then had given that adoration to it, that is now paid in the Roman Church, and if they had declared, either for a <hi>Corporal Preſence,</hi> or an <hi>oral Manducation</hi> of him that was their God, they had the fruitfulleſt Subject in the World given them, both to turn off all the Objections of the Chriſtians againſt themſelves, for worſhipping ſenſeleſs and inanimate things; and alſo to lay the moſt plauſible Charge of folly and madneſs againſt them, which their great <hi>Orator</hi>

            <p n="1">
               <q>1. Vos Chriſtiani dicitis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ye Chriſtians ſay in that Sacrament <hi>(of the Euchariſt)</hi> there is really the Body and Blood of Chriſt. This is impoſſible. Becauſe when your Chriſt, ſhowing the Bread, ſaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> he ſpake <hi>ſignificatively,</hi> and not <hi>really;</hi> as if he had ſaid, this is the Sign or Figure of my Body. After which way of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>The Rock was Chriſt;</hi> that is, a Figure of Chriſt. And it appears evidently, that this was the Intention of your Chriſt, becauſe when he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed about the eating his Body, and drinking his Blood, to lay the offence that roſe upon it among the Diſciples, he ſays, as it were, expounding himſelf, <hi>The words that I have ſpoken to you are Spirit and Life:</hi> denoting, that what he had ſaid, was to be underſtood, not according to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but according to the Spiritual Sence. And when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> holding Bread in his Hands, he meant, that that Bread was his Body <hi>(in potentia propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua)</hi> in a near poſſibility, <hi>viz.</hi> after he had eaten it, for then it would be turned into his. Body, or into his Fleſh; and ſo likewiſe the Wine. And after this manner we Jews do, on the day of Unleavened Bread; for we take unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened Bread in memory of that time, when our Fathers were brought out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64618:121"/>to ſtay ſo long there, as whilſt the Bread might be leavened, that was the Bread of the Paſſover; and we ſay; <hi>This is the Bread which our Fathers ate,</hi> though that be not preſent, ſince it is paſt and gone; and ſo this unleavened Bread, minds us of the Bread of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>this Bread</hi> is not <hi>that;</hi> ſo is that Bread of which the Sacrifice of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar is made. It is ſufficient for Chriſtians to ſay, that it is in memory of that Bread of Chriſt, though <hi>this Bread</hi> be not <hi>that.</hi> And becauſe it was impoſſible that one Bit of his Fleſh ſhould be preſerved in memory of him, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that that Bread ſhould be made, and that Wine, which was his Fleſh and Blood in the next remove to come into act; as we Jews do, <hi>(and Chriſt borrowed his Phraſes and the Elements from their Supper)</hi> at the Paſſover with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened Bread, as we ſaid before. When therefore your Chriſt at the Table took Bread, and the Cup, and gave them to his Diſciples, he did not bid them believe that the Bread and Wine were turned into his Body and Blood, but that as often as they did that, they ſhould do it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him, <hi>viz.</hi> in memory of that paſt Bread: and if you Chriſtians did underſtand it ſo, no impoſſibility would follow; but to ſay the contrary, as you aſſert, is to ſay an impoſſible thing, and againſt the intention of your Chriſt, as we have ſhow'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is what the Jew urges with great reaſon. But the Catholick Author makes a poor Anſwer to it, and has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay, in effect, but this, <hi>That the Tradition of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church concerning this Sacrament is true.</hi> viz. <hi>That in this Sacrament there is really, and not by way of Signification, the True Body and True Blood of Chriſt.</hi>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64618:122"/>the Eye, though Men knew not how it was done. So alſo in the caſe of the Ark of the Covenant of Old, mighty Miracles were wrought; and thoſe not only ſenſible Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but alſo publick, and apparent to all the People; (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that Infidels were terrifyed at the very report of ſuch Miracles) Men ſeeing before their Eyes the Divine Power brightly ſhining in Reverence of the Ark of his Covenant, as appears in his Dividing the Waters of <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> while the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſed over dry-ſhod, the Waters on one ſide ſwelling like a Mountain, and on the other flowing down as far as the dead Sea, till the Prieſts with the Ark went over the Chanel of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and then <hi>Jordan</hi> returned to its wonted courſe. But the Kings of the <hi>Amorites</hi> and <hi>Canaanites</hi> hearing of ſo great and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick a Miracle, were ſo confounded with the terror of God, that no Spirit remained in them (<hi>Joſu.</hi> c. 4. &amp; 5.) and ſo I might inſtance in many other Evident Miracles, which to avoid tediouſneſs, I omit. And yet in that Ark, neither God nor Chriſt was really contained, but only the Tables of Stone containing the Precepts of the Decalogue, and the Pot of Manna, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>Exod.</hi> 16.) and the Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> that flouriſhed in the Houſe of <hi>Levi</hi> (<hi>Numb.</hi> 17.) If therefore by the Ark (that carried only the foreſaid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that were inanimate, how ſacred ſoever they were) God wrought in Honour of it ſuch evident far-ſpreading and publick Miracles, how much more powerfully ſhould they have been wrought by him, if it were true, that in your Sacrament of the Altar the true God or Chriſt were really contained, whom you affirm that he ought to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped and venerated infinitely above all. Since therefore no ſuch thing do's appear there to the Eye, it follows that it is impoſſible for any Miracle to be done there, ſince this is againſt the Nature of a Miracle.</q>

               <q>You Chriſtians do aſſert, that the true Body of Chriſt begins to be on the Altar. This ſeems to be impoſſible;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64618:122"/>For a thing begins to be where it was not before, two ways. Either by Local Motion, or by the converſion of another thing into it; as appears in Fire, which begins to be any where, either becauſe it is kindled there anew, or is brought thither <hi>de novo.</hi>

               <q>But it is manifeſt, that the true Body of Chriſt was not always on the Altar; becauſe the Chriſtians aſſert, that Chriſt aſcended in his Body to Heaven. It ſeems alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be ſaid, that any thing here is converted anew into Chriſt's Body; becauſe nothing ſeems convertible into that which exiſted before; ſince that into which another thing is turned, by ſuch a change, begins to exiſt. Now it is manifeſt, that Chriſt's Body did praeexiſt, ſeeing it was conceived in the Womb of <hi>Mary.</hi> It ſeems therefore impoſſible, that it ſhould begin to be on the Altar anew, by the Converſion of another thing into it.</q>

               <q>In like manner, neither by a change of Place, becauſe every thing that is locally moved, do's ſo begin to be in one place, that it ceaſes to be in that other in which it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. We muſt therefore ſay, that when Chriſt begins to be on this Altar on which the Sacrament is perform'd, he ceaſes to be in Heaven whither he aſcended.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſſible that a greater Body ſhould be included in the place of a leſſer Body. But it is manifeſt, that the True Body of Chriſt is of a greater Quantity than the Bread that is offered on the Altar. Therefore it ſeems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that the true Body of Chriſt ſhould be whole and entire there, where the Bread ſeems to be.
