#####Body#####

1. CHAP. I. The Firſt Difference. The Church of Rome is forced to aſſert a continued Series of Miracles to juſtifie her Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation. But the Fathers never mention any Miracles in the Euchariſt, ſave only the Effects of God's powerful Grace, working great Changes in us, and advancing the Elements in the uſe of them thereunto, without changing their Nature and Subſtance.

    _ 1 Aſſertion. They aſſert, That every Organiz'd Body, not excepting the Body of Chriſt, is viſible and palpable.

    _ 2 Aſſertion. The Fathers aſſert, That every Body is quantum, and as it ahs Quantity, poſſeſſes a Place or Space, and is commenſurate to it: That a Body cannot be in more than one Place, nor be intire in one Part, nor exiſt after the manner of a Spirit. All which are falſe, if Tranſubſtantiation be true.

    _ 3 Aſſertion. That is it impoſſible for one to dwell in himſelf, or to partake of, and have ones own Body in himſelf; becauſe whatſoever contains, muſt be greater than that which is contained in it; and there would be a Penetration of Dimenſions, which they deny.

    _ 1. Not ſanctified properly.

    _ 2. Not ſacrificed properly.

    _ 1. Of Miraculous Changes in Nature.

    _ 2. Of the Change by the Fall.

    _ 3. Of the Change by Regeneration.

    _ 4. Of the Change in the Incarnation of Chriſt, and the Reſurrection.

    _ 5. Of the Change in Baptiſm.

    _ 1 Poſition. The Fathers ever ſince Chriſt's departure and Aſcenſion into Heaven, look upon his Body as abſent from Earth, tho' in another ſenſe he is ſtill preſent.

    _ 2 Poſition. The Fathers diſtinguiſh the Preſence of Chriſt's Body from the Sacrament of it, which they make to
be a Memorial and Pledge of Chriſt, as gone away and abſent.

    _ 3 Poſition. Whatſoever Preſence of Chriſt the Fathers ſpeak of in the Euchariſt, they acknowledge the ſame in Baptiſm,
and in as full Expreſſions. So that if we will follow the Fathers, we may as well aſſert a Subſtantial Preſence of Chriſt's Body in Baptiſm, as in the Euchariſt. But this on all hands is denied.

    _ 4. Poſition. The Fathers ſo conſider the Preſence of Chriſt's Body in the Euchariſt, as can no way agree to the Preſence of his natural and glorified Body there.

    _ 5 Poſition. That according to the Fathers, the Preſence of Chriſt's Body to us now, is a Preſence to our Faith and Minds, a Preſence of Union, of Efficacy and Grace.

    _ 1 Conſideration. It appears there is no neceſſity to underſtand eating and drinking Chriſt's Body in the Eucharist, of his natural Body received into ours; becauſe the Fathers ſay, We eat and drink, and partake of Chriſt's Body and Blood in Baptiſm, which, by the confeſſion of all, can be done only ſpiritually there.

    _ 2 Conſideration. The Fathers, with reference to Eating and Drinking, diſtinguiſh Chriſt's True Body from his Sacramental one; which they could not do, if Chriſt's True and Natural Body and Blood were eat and drunk in a proper ſenſe in the Sacrament.

    _ 3 Conſideration. They ſay, That the Fathers under the Old Teſtament did eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat with us; and give this as the Reaſon why it is ſpiritual Meat, Becauſe it is not eaten corporally, but by Faith. Therefore both they and we muſt eat the ſame Meat only ſpiritually, not corporally.

    _ 4 Conſideration. The Body and Blood are to be eaten and drunk, and to be received, as they are repreſented and ſet before us in the Sacrament. But there the Body of Chriſt (according to the Fathers as well as the Scriptures) is ſet before us as broken and dead, and his Blood as poured out of his Veins. Therefore it can be eaten and drunk by us only figuratively and ſpiritually.

1. CHAP. II. The Second Difference. The Church of Rome differs from the Fathers, in determining what that thing is which Chriſt calls MY BODY.

    _ 1 Aſſertion. They aſſert, That every Organiz'd Body, not excepting the Body of Chriſt, is viſible and palpable.

    _ 2 Aſſertion. The Fathers aſſert, That every Body is quantum, and as it ahs Quantity, poſſeſſes a Place or Space, and is commenſurate to it: That a Body cannot be in more than one Place, nor be intire in one Part, nor exiſt after the manner of a Spirit. All which are falſe, if Tranſubſtantiation be true.

    _ 3 Aſſertion. That is it impoſſible for one to dwell in himſelf, or to partake of, and have ones own Body in himſelf; becauſe whatſoever contains, muſt be greater than that which is contained in it; and there would be a Penetration of Dimenſions, which they deny.

be a Memorial and Pledge of Chriſt, as gone away and abſent.

    _ 3 Poſition. Whatſoever Preſence of Chriſt the Fathers ſpeak of in the Euchariſt, they acknowledge the ſame in Baptiſm,
and in as full Expreſſions. So that if we will follow the Fathers, we may as well aſſert a Subſtantial Preſence of Chriſt's Body in Baptiſm, as in the Euchariſt. But this on all hands is denied.

    _ 4. Poſition. The Fathers ſo conſider the Preſence of Chriſt's Body in the Euchariſt, as can no way agree to the Preſence of his natural and glorified Body there.

    _ 5 Poſition. That according to the Fathers, the Preſence of Chriſt's Body to us now, is a Preſence to our Faith and Minds, a Preſence of Union, of Efficacy and Grace.

    _ 2 Conſideration. The Fathers, with reference to Eating and Drinking, diſtinguiſh Chriſt's True Body from his Sacramental one; which they could not do, if Chriſt's True and Natural Body and Blood were eat and drunk in a proper ſenſe in the Sacrament.

    _ 3 Conſideration. They ſay, That the Fathers under the Old Teſtament did eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat with us; and give this as the Reaſon why it is ſpiritual Meat, Becauſe it is not eaten corporally, but by Faith. Therefore both they and we muſt eat the ſame Meat only ſpiritually, not corporally.

    _ 4 Conſideration. The Body and Blood are to be eaten and drunk, and to be received, as they are repreſented and ſet before us in the Sacrament. But there the Body of Chriſt (according to the Fathers as well as the Scriptures) is ſet before us as broken and dead, and his Blood as poured out of his Veins. Therefore it can be eaten and drunk by us only figuratively and ſpiritually.

1. CHAP. III. The Third Difference. The Church of Rome believes, That Accidents in the Euchariſt ſubſiſt without a Subject; but the Fathers ſay the contrary, That Accidents cannot ſubſiſt without a Subject, and yet never except the Euchariſt.

    _ 1 Aſſertion. They aſſert, That every Organiz'd Body, not excepting the Body of Chriſt, is viſible and palpable.

    _ 2 Aſſertion. The Fathers aſſert, That every Body is quantum, and as it ahs Quantity, poſſeſſes a Place or Space, and is commenſurate to it: That a Body cannot be in more than one Place, nor be intire in one Part, nor exiſt after the manner of a Spirit. All which are falſe, if Tranſubſtantiation be true.

    _ 3 Aſſertion. That is it impoſſible for one to dwell in himſelf, or to partake of, and have ones own Body in himſelf; becauſe whatſoever contains, muſt be greater than that which is contained in it; and there would be a Penetration of Dimenſions, which they deny.

Therefore both they and we muſt eat the ſame Meat only ſpiritually, not corporally.

    _ 4 Conſideration. The Body and Blood are to be eaten and drunk, and to be received, as they are repreſented and ſet before us in the Sacrament. But there the Body of Chriſt (according to the Fathers as well as the Scriptures) is ſet before us as broken and dead, and his Blood as poured out of his Veins. Therefore it can be eaten and drunk by us only figuratively and ſpiritually.

1. CHAP. IV. The Fourth Difference. The Church of Rome has brought in the Word SPECIES, to ſignifie thoſe Accidents without any Subject: But the Fathers never take it in this Senſe.

    _ 1 Aſſertion. They aſſert, That every Organiz'd Body, not excepting the Body of Chriſt, is viſible and palpable.

    _ 2 Aſſertion. The Fathers aſſert, That every Body is quantum, and as it ahs Quantity, poſſeſſes a Place or Space, and is commenſurate to it: That a Body cannot be in more than one Place, nor be intire in one Part, nor exiſt after the manner of a Spirit.

Therefore it can be eaten and drunk by us only figuratively and ſpiritually.

1. CHAP. V. The Fifth Difference. The Fathers differ from the Roman Church, in their Aſſertions about the Nature and Properties of Bodies.

    _ 1 Aſſertion. They aſſert, That every Organiz'd Body, not excepting the Body of Chriſt, is viſible and palpable.

    _ 2 Aſſertion. The Fathers aſſert, That every Body is quantum, and as it ahs Quantity, poſſeſſes a Place or Space, and is commenſurate to it: That a Body cannot be in more than one Place, nor be intire in one Part, nor exiſt after the manner of a Spirit.

Therefore it can be eaten and drunk by us only figuratively and ſpiritually.

1. CHAP. VI. The Sixth Difference. The Church of Rome (ſuitably to the ſtrange Doctrine it teaches about Chriſt's Body and Blood) teaches us not to believe the Report our Senſes make, That the Subſtance of Bread and Wine remain in the Sacrament; but to paſs a contrary Judgment to what they inform us herein. But the Fathers teach the contrary, That we may ſecurely relie upon the Evidence of our Senſes, as to any Body, even as to the true Body of Chriſt.

    _ 1 Aſſertion. They aſſert, That every Organiz'd Body, not excepting the Body of Chriſt, is viſible and palpable.

    _ 2 Aſſertion. The Fathers aſſert, That every Body is quantum, and as it ahs Quantity, poſſeſſes a Place or Space, and is commenſurate to it: That a Body cannot be in more than one Place, nor be intire in one Part, nor exiſt after the manner of a Spirit.

    _ 3 Conſideration. They ſay, That the Fathers under the Old Teſtament did eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat with us; and give this as the Reaſon why it is ſpiritual Meat, Becauſe it is not eaten corporally, but by Faith. Therefore both they and we muſt eat the ſame Meat only ſpiritually, not corporally.

    _ 4 Conſideration. The Body and Blood are to be eaten and drunk, and to be received, as they are repreſented and ſet before us in the Sacrament. But there the Body of Chriſt (according to the Fathers as well as the Scriptures) is ſet before us as broken and dead, and his Blood as poured out of his Veins. Therefore it can be eaten and drunk by us only figuratively and ſpiritually.

1. CHAP. VII. The Seventh Difference. When the Fathers call the Euchariſt Chriſt's Body and Blood, the Roman Church underſtands it of Chriſts natural Body given there. But the Fathers do not ſo; but underſtand it moſt commonly of the Elements of Bread and Wine, even when they call them the Body of Chriſt, and give us the reaſons why they ſo call them.

    _ 1 Aſſertion. They aſſert, That every Organiz'd Body, not excepting the Body of Chriſt, is viſible and palpable.

    _ 2 Aſſertion. The Fathers aſſert, That every Body is quantum, and as it ahs Quantity, poſſeſſes a Place or Space, and is commenſurate to it: That a Body cannot be in more than one Place, nor be intire in one Part, nor exiſt after the manner of a Spirit. All which are falſe, if Tranſubſtantiation be true.

    _ 3 Aſſertion. That is it impoſſible for one to dwell in himſelf, or to partake of, and have ones own Body in himſelf; becauſe whatſoever contains, muſt be greater than that which is contained in it; and there would be a Penetration of Dimenſions, which they deny.

Therefore both they and we muſt eat the ſame Meat only ſpiritually, not corporally.

    _ 4 Conſideration. The Body and Blood are to be eaten and drunk, and to be received, as they are repreſented and ſet before us in the Sacrament. But there the Body of Chriſt (according to the Fathers as well as the Scriptures) is ſet before us as broken and dead, and his Blood as poured out of his Veins. Therefore it can be eaten and drunk by us only figuratively and ſpiritually.

1. CHAP. VIII. The Eighth Difference. The Church of Rome in all Sayings of the Fathers-that mention a Change and Converſion in the Euchariſt, underſtand it of ſuch a Change as aboliſhes the Subſtance of Bread and Wine, the Accidents only remaining: But the Fathers never uſe theſe Phraſes in this Senſe.

    _ 1 Aſſertion. They aſſert, That every Organiz'd Body, not excepting the Body of Chriſt, is viſible and palpable.

    _ 2 Aſſertion. The Fathers aſſert, That every Body is quantum, and as it ahs Quantity, poſſeſſes a Place or Space, and is commenſurate to it: That a Body cannot be in more than one Place, nor be intire in one Part, nor exiſt after the manner of a Spirit.

    _ 1 Poſition. The Fathers ever ſince Chriſt's departure and Aſcenſion into Heaven, look upon his Body as abſent from Earth, tho' in another ſenſe he is ſtill preſent.

    _ 2 Poſition. The Fathers diſtinguiſh the Preſence of Chriſt's Body from the Sacrament of it, which they make to
be a Memorial and Pledge of Chriſt, as gone away and abſent.

    _ 3 Poſition. Whatſoever Preſence of Chriſt the Fathers ſpeak of in the Euchariſt, they acknowledge the ſame in Baptiſm,
and in as full Expreſſions. So that if we will follow the Fathers, we may as well aſſert a Subſtantial Preſence of Chriſt's Body in Baptiſm, as in the Euchariſt. But this on all hands is denied.

    _ 4. Poſition. The Fathers ſo conſider the Preſence of Chriſt's Body in the Euchariſt, as can no way agree to the Preſence of his natural and glorified Body there.

    _ 5 Poſition. That according to the Fathers, the Preſence of Chriſt's Body to us now, is a Preſence to our Faith and Minds, a Preſence of Union, of Efficacy and Grace.

    _ 1 Conſideration. It appears there is no neceſſity to underſtand eating and drinking Chriſt's Body in the Eucharist, of his natural Body received into ours; becauſe the Fathers ſay, We eat and drink, and partake of Chriſt's Body and Blood in Baptiſm, which, by the confeſſion of all, can be done only ſpiritually there.

    _ 2 Conſideration. The Fathers, with reference to Eating and Drinking, diſtinguiſh Chriſt's True Body from his Sacramental one; which they could not do, if Chriſt's True and Natural Body and Blood were eat and drunk in a proper ſenſe in the Sacrament.

    _ 3 Conſideration. They ſay, That the Fathers under the Old Teſtament did eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat with us; and give this as the Reaſon why it is ſpiritual Meat, Becauſe it is not eaten corporally, but by Faith. Therefore both they and we muſt eat the ſame Meat only ſpiritually, not corporally.

    _ 4 Conſideration. The Body and Blood are to be eaten and drunk, and to be received, as they are repreſented and ſet before us in the Sacrament. But there the Body of Chriſt (according to the Fathers as well as the Scriptures) is ſet before us as broken and dead, and his Blood as poured out of his Veins. Therefore it can be eaten and drunk by us only figuratively and ſpiritually.

1. CHAP. IX. The Ninth Difference. The Fathers differ from the Church of Rome, in their Belief of Chriſt's Preſence in the Euchariſt. The Church of Rome aſſerts the ſubſtantial Preſence of Chriſt's Natural Body there; but the Fathers deny it.

    _ 1 Aſſertion. They aſſert, That every Organiz'd Body, not excepting the Body of Chriſt, is viſible and palpable.

    _ 2 Aſſertion. The Fathers aſſert, That every Body is quantum, and as it ahs Quantity, poſſeſſes a Place or Space, and is commenſurate to it: That a Body cannot be in more than one Place, nor be intire in one Part, nor exiſt after the manner of a Spirit. All which are falſe, if Tranſubſtantiation be true.

    _ 3 Aſſertion. That is it impoſſible for one to dwell in himſelf, or to partake of, and have ones own Body in himſelf; becauſe whatſoever contains, muſt be greater than that which is contained in it; and there would be a Penetration of Dimenſions, which they deny.

Therefore it can be eaten and drunk by us only figuratively and ſpiritually.

1. CHAP. X. The Tenth Difference. The Fathers aſſert poſitively, that the ſubſtance of the Elements remain after Conſecration; that Bread and Wine are taken, eaten and drunk in the Sacrament: which all that believe Tranſubſtantiation muſt deny.

    _ 1 Aſſertion. They aſſert, That every Organiz'd Body, not excepting the Body of Chriſt, is viſible and palpable.

    _ 2 Aſſertion. The Fathers aſſert, That every Body is quantum, and as it ahs Quantity, poſſeſſes a Place or Space, and is commenſurate to it: That a Body cannot be in more than one Place, nor be intire in one Part, nor exiſt after the manner of a Spirit.

Therefore it can be eaten and drunk by us only figuratively and ſpiritually.

1. CHAP. XI. The Eleventh Difference. The Fathers make the Bread and Wine to be the Sacrament, Sign, Figure, Type, Antitype, Image, &c. of Chriſts Body and Blood. They of the Church of Rome, make either the Accidents ſubſiſting without a Subject, or the Body of Chriſt latent under thoſe Accidents, to be the Sacrament, Sign, Figure, &c. and not the ſubstance of Bread and Wine, which they ſay is aboliſhed. Therefore they have no Sacrament ſuch as the Fathers aſſert.

    _ 1 Aſſertion. They aſſert, That every Organiz'd Body, not excepting the Body of Chriſt, is viſible and palpable.

    _ 2 Aſſertion. The Fathers aſſert, That every Body is quantum, and as it ahs Quantity, poſſeſſes a Place or Space, and is commenſurate to it: That a Body cannot be in more than one Place, nor be intire in one Part, nor exiſt after the manner of a Spirit.

Therefore it can be eaten and drunk by us only figuratively and ſpiritually.

1. CHAP. XII. The Twelfth Difference. The Fathers aſſert, That Christ's Body is not eaten corporally and carnally, but only ſpiritually. But the Church of Rome teaches a Corporal Eating, a Deſcent of Chriſt's Natural Body into ours, and understands the Eating of Chriſt's Body literally and carnally.

    _ 1 Aſſertion. They aſſert, That every Organiz'd Body, not excepting the Body of Chriſt, is viſible and palpable.

    _ 2 Aſſertion.

1. CHAP. XIV. The Fourteenth Difference. Several Ʋſages and Practices of the Fathers relating to the Euchariſt, declare, That they did not believe Tranſubſtantiation, or the Preſence of Chriſt's Natural Body there; whoſe contrary practices or forbearance of them, in the Roman Church, are the Conſequences of that belief. As alſo ſome things the preſent Roman Church practiſes, becauſe they believe Tranſubſtantiation, and the Corporal Preſence, and dare not neglect to practiſe, ſo believing; which yet the Ancient Church did forbear the practice of, not knowing any obligation thereto; which plainly argues their different Sentiments about the Euchariſt in thoſe Points.

1. CHAP. XVI. The Sixteenth Difference. Our Ancient Roman-Saxon Church differred from the preſent Roman Church, in the Article of Tranſubſtantiation and Corporal Preſence.

    _ 1 Aſſertion. They aſſert, That every Organiz'd Body, not excepting the Body of Chriſt, is viſible and palpable.

    _ 2 Aſſertion. The Fathers aſſert, That every Body is quantum, and as it ahs Quantity, poſſeſſes a Place or Space, and is commenſurate to it: That a Body cannot be in more than one Place, nor be intire in one Part, nor exiſt after the manner of a Spirit. All which are falſe, if Tranſubſtantiation be true.

    _ 3 Aſſertion. That is it impoſſible for one to dwell in himſelf, or to partake of, and have ones own Body in himſelf; becauſe whatſoever contains, muſt be greater than that which is contained in it; and there would be a Penetration of Dimenſions, which they deny.

    _ 1. Not ſanctified properly.

    _ 2. Not ſacrificed properly.

    _ 1. Of Miraculous Changes in Nature.

    _ 2. Of the Change by the Fall.

    _ 3. Of the Change by Regeneration.

    _ 4. Of the Change in the Incarnation of Chriſt, and the Reſurrection.

    _ 5. Of the Change in Baptiſm.

    _ 1 Poſition. The Fathers ever ſince Chriſt's departure and Aſcenſion into Heaven, look upon his Body as abſent from Earth, tho' in another ſenſe he is ſtill preſent.

    _ 2 Poſition. The Fathers diſtinguiſh the Preſence of Chriſt's Body from the Sacrament of it, which they make to
be a Memorial and Pledge of Chriſt, as gone away and abſent.

    _ 3 Poſition. Whatſoever Preſence of Chriſt the Fathers ſpeak of in the Euchariſt, they acknowledge the ſame in Baptiſm,
and in as full Expreſſions. So that if we will follow the Fathers, we may as well aſſert a Subſtantial Preſence of Chriſt's Body in Baptiſm, as in the Euchariſt. But this on all hands is denied.

    _ 4. Poſition. The Fathers ſo conſider the Preſence of Chriſt's Body in the Euchariſt, as can no way agree to the Preſence of his natural and glorified Body there.

    _ 5 Poſition. That according to the Fathers, the Preſence of Chriſt's Body to us now, is a Preſence to our Faith and Minds, a Preſence of Union, of Efficacy and Grace.

    _ 1 Conſideration. It appears there is no neceſſity to underſtand eating and drinking Chriſt's Body in the Eucharist, of his natural Body received into ours; becauſe the Fathers ſay, We eat and drink, and partake of Chriſt's Body and Blood in Baptiſm, which, by the confeſſion of all, can be done only ſpiritually there.

    _ 2 Conſideration. The Fathers, with reference to Eating and Drinking, diſtinguiſh Chriſt's True Body from his Sacramental one; which they could not do, if Chriſt's True and Natural Body and Blood were eat and drunk in a proper ſenſe in the Sacrament.

    _ 3 Conſideration. They ſay, That the Fathers under the Old Teſtament did eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat with us; and give this as the Reaſon why it is ſpiritual Meat, Becauſe it is not eaten corporally, but by Faith. Therefore both they and we muſt eat the ſame Meat only ſpiritually, not corporally.

    _ 4 Conſideration. The Body and Blood are to be eaten and drunk, and to be received, as they are repreſented and ſet before us in the Sacrament. But there the Body of Chriſt (according to the Fathers as well as the Scriptures) is ſet before us as broken and dead, and his Blood as poured out of his Veins. Therefore it can be eaten and drunk by us only figuratively and ſpiritually.

1. CHAP. XVII. The CONCLUSION. That the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation has given a new occaſion to the Enemies of Chriſtian Religion to blaſpheme. It is ſo great a ſtumbling-block to the Jews, that their Converſion is hopeleſs, whilſt this is believed by them to be the Common Faith of Chriſtians. That tho' the Church of Rome will not hearken to us, yet they may be provoked to emulation by the Jews themſelves, who have given a better account of Chriſt's Words of Inſtitution, and more agreeable to the Fathers, than this Church has; and raiſed unanſwerable Objections againſt its Doctrine.

    _ 1 Aſſertion. They aſſert, That every Organiz'd Body, not excepting the Body of Chriſt, is viſible and palpable.

    _ 2 Aſſertion. The Fathers aſſert, That every Body is quantum, and as it ahs Quantity, poſſeſſes a Place or Space, and is commenſurate to it: That a Body cannot be in more than one Place, nor be intire in one Part, nor exiſt after the manner of a Spirit. All which are falſe, if Tranſubſtantiation be true.

    _ 3 Aſſertion. That is it impoſſible for one to dwell in himſelf, or to partake of, and have ones own Body in himſelf; becauſe whatſoever contains, muſt be greater than that which is contained in it; and there would be a Penetration of Dimenſions, which they deny.

    _ 1. Not ſanctified properly.

    _ 2. Not ſacrificed properly.

    _ 1. Of Miraculous Changes in Nature.

    _ 2. Of the Change by the Fall.

    _ 3. Of the Change by Regeneration.

    _ 4. Of the Change in the Incarnation of Chriſt, and the Reſurrection.

    _ 5. Of the Change in Baptiſm.

    _ 1 Poſition. The Fathers ever ſince Chriſt's departure and Aſcenſion into Heaven, look upon his Body as abſent from Earth, tho' in another ſenſe he is ſtill preſent.

    _ 2 Poſition. The Fathers diſtinguiſh the Preſence of Chriſt's Body from the Sacrament of it, which they make to

and in as full Expreſſions. So that if we will follow the Fathers, we may as well aſſert a Subſtantial Preſence of Chriſt's Body in Baptiſm, as in the Euchariſt. But this on all hands is denied.

    _ 4. Poſition. The Fathers ſo conſider the Preſence of Chriſt's Body in the Euchariſt, as can no way agree to the Preſence of his natural and glorified Body there.

    _ 5 Poſition. That according to the Fathers, the Preſence of Chriſt's Body to us now, is a Preſence to our Faith and Minds, a Preſence of Union, of Efficacy and Grace.

    _ 1 Conſideration.

    _ 2 Conſideration. The Fathers, with reference to Eating and Drinking, diſtinguiſh Chriſt's True Body from his Sacramental one; which they could not do, if Chriſt's True and Natural Body and Blood were eat and drunk in a proper ſenſe in the Sacrament.

    _ 3 Conſideration. They ſay, That the Fathers under the Old Teſtament did eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat with us; and give this as the Reaſon why it is ſpiritual Meat, Becauſe it is not eaten corporally, but by Faith. Therefore both they and we muſt eat the ſame Meat only ſpiritually, not corporally.

    _ 4 Conſideration. The Body and Blood are to be eaten and drunk, and to be received, as they are repreſented and ſet before us in the Sacrament. But there the Body of Chriſt (according to the Fathers as well as the Scriptures) is ſet before us as broken and dead, and his Blood as poured out of his Veins. Therefore it can be eaten and drunk by us only figuratively and ſpiritually.
